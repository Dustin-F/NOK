## How It Works

NOK randomly holds down the `W` key for a specified duration (1-5 seconds by default), waits for a customizable period (1-5 minutes by default), and then holds down the `S` key for another random duration (3-9 seconds by default). This cycle repeats indefinitely until the script is stopped.

2. **Stop the Script**:
   - Click the **Stop** button to pause the automation.

3. **Customize Settings**:
   - Click the **Settings** button to adjust:
     - `W` key duration (in seconds).

     - Wait time between actions (in minutes and seconds).
   - Use the **Set to Default** button to reset all settings to their default values.

4. **View Logs**:
